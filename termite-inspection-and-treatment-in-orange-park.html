                    <div class="testimonial-text">Had Terminix come out last month for a termite inspection before we closed on our house. The technician (I think his name was Dave?) was really thorough and took about 45 minutes going through everything. Found some old damage in the garage but nothing active, which was a relief! He explained everything in terms I could understand and didn't try to upsell me on anything. Got the report the next day via email. Only complaint is they were about 20 minutes late to the appointment, but they called ahead to let me know. Overall happy with the service.</div>

                <div class="testimonial">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">Excellent service from start to finish! We discovered what looked like termite damage near our back patio and called Terminix on a Tuesday. They had someone out by Friday for the inspection - much faster than I expected. The inspector was incredibly knowledgeable and found an active colony that we never would have spotted ourselves. The treatment took two visits over about 3 weeks, and they've been back twice for follow-up checks at no extra charge. Been 6 months now with no issues. These guys know what they're doing and stand behind their work. Highly recommend!</div>

                    <div class="testimonial-text">Called them after finding some suspicious wood damage in my kitchen. The inspection was pretty standard - guy was nice enough and seemed to know his stuff. Found termites in two spots and quoted me for treatment. Price was fair compared to other companies I called. Treatment went fine, took about 2 hours. They came back a month later to check and everything looked good. No complaints really, just wasn't blown away by anything special. Did the job they said they would do.</div>

                        <summary>How much does a termite inspection cost in Orange Park, and what does it include?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">Our comprehensive termite inspections in Orange Park typically cost between $75-$150, depending on your home's size and accessibility. The inspection includes a thorough examination of your foundation, crawl spaces, attic, and all wooden structures, plus moisture level testing around your property. Given Orange Park's humid climate and sandy soil conditions that attract subterranean termites, we also check for conducive conditions like wood-to-soil contact and drainage issues. You'll receive a detailed written report within 24 hours, including photos of any findings and recommendations. If treatment is needed and you choose our services, we often credit the inspection fee toward your treatment cost.</div>

                        <summary>What types of termites are common in Orange Park, FL, and how do you treat them?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">In Orange Park, we primarily deal with Eastern Subterranean termites, which thrive in our humid subtropical climate and sandy soils. These termites build mud tubes from the ground to access wood in your home. Our treatment approach typically involves installing a liquid termiticide barrier around your home's perimeter and using monitoring stations with bait systems. For active infestations, we may also use targeted spot treatments and foam applications in wall voids. The treatment process usually takes 4-6 hours for an average home, and our technicians are fully licensed by the Florida Department of Agriculture. We also address Formosan termites when present, though they're less common in our area.</div>

                        <summary>How long does termite treatment take to work, and when will I see results?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">You'll typically start seeing dead termites within 7-14 days after treatment, which is actually a good sign that the treatment is working. Complete colony elimination usually takes 30-90 days, depending on the colony size and termite species. During this time, you might notice increased termite activity initially as they encounter the treatment - this is normal. Our liquid barrier treatments provide immediate protection, while bait stations work more gradually but eliminate the entire colony. We schedule a follow-up inspection 30 days after treatment to monitor progress, and then quarterly inspections for the first year. Given Orange Park's year-round termite season, consistent monitoring is especially important here.</div>

                        <summary>Do you offer warranties on termite treatments, and what happens if termites come back?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">Yes, we provide a comprehensive warranty that covers both re-treatment and repair of new termite damage. Our standard warranty includes annual inspections and re-treatment at no additional cost if termites return to treated areas. If new damage occurs in warranted areas, we'll repair it at no charge. The warranty remains valid as long as you maintain our annual renewal program, which includes inspections and any necessary touch-up treatments. This is particularly valuable in Orange Park because our warm, humid climate means termites are active year-round. We also offer a damage repair guarantee up to $1 million for qualifying treatments. All warranty terms are clearly outlined in your service agreement, and our local Orange Park office handles all warranty claims quickly.</div>

                        <summary>How do I prepare my home for termite treatment, and will I need to leave during the process?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">Preparation is minimal for most treatments. You'll need to clear items away from your home's foundation (about 3 feet), remove stored items from crawl spaces if accessible, and ensure we can access areas around your home's perimeter. For interior treatments, we may need access to specific rooms or utility areas. You typically don't need to leave your home during exterior treatments, but we recommend keeping children and pets inside while we work. If we need to treat interior areas or use fumigation (rare), we'll discuss temporary relocation. Given Orange Park's frequent afternoon storms, we monitor weather closely and may reschedule outdoor treatments if heavy rain is expected within 24 hours of application. Our technicians will walk you through specific preparation steps when we schedule your service.</div>
